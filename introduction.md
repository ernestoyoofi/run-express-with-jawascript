<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ernestoyoofi/jawascript/main/jawascript-icon.png" align="right" width="90"/>

A script built in Javanese Language, a language that is easy to use and implement and has the same structure as JavaScript because it is only a translation.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was inspired by [RioChndr/jaksel-language](https://github.com/RioChndr/jaksel-language), thanks for inspiring me! and i'm not focusing on the top priority of this project, but if you want to try developing or updating on my repo please do, if there are any problems please report them, this is also just entertainment material.

## How does this happen

Where in this script there is one file to define all the syntax from Javanese to javascript which is really common javascript, everything is done without any library just enough to overwrite and translate it into javascript.

## How to use

You can simply install it into the global module on npm or yarn, you are free to use what you want but give this script to global.

```bash
npm i -g jawascript@https://github.com/ernestoyoofi/jawascript
```

Then to run the script use a command like this

```bash
jawaskrip <filename>.jawa
# or use
jawaskrip <filename>.jw
```

For you to try to build this jawascript into javascript use the `--dir` flag or arg and then forward the folder you want to build to

```bash
jawaskrip --dir ./myproject
```

## Example

Check this [folder](./example) or documentation [in here](https://ernestoyoofi.github.io/jawascript)

## Others

If there are problems such as syntax not reading properly or mistranslate, please report it, if there are additions or want to change it, please change the script or make a new report so I can update it.
